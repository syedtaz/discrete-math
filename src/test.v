(* We define an inductive datatype binop to stand for the binary operators of our source language *)
Inductive binop : Set := Plus | Times.

(* We write that a constant may be built from one argument, a natural number; and a binary operation may be built from a choice of operator and two operand expressions. *)
Inductive exp : Set := 
    | Const : nat -> exp
    | Binop : binop -> exp -> exp -> exp.

(* The meaning of a binary operator is a binary function over nat referring to the
functions plus and mult from the Coq standard library. *)
Definition binopDenote (b : binop) : nat -> nat -> nat :=
    match b with
        | Plus => plus

(* An instruction either pushes a constant onto the stack or pops two arguments, applies a binary operator to them, and pushes the result onto the stack.*)
Inductive instr : Set :=
    | iConst : nat -> instr
    | iBinop : binop -> instr.

Definition prog := list instr.
Definition stack := list nat.


(* We can give instructions meanings as functions from stacks to optional stacks, where running an instruction results in None in case of a stack underflow and results in Some sâ€™ when the result of execution is the new stack sâ€™ *)
